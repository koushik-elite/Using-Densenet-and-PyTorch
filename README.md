# Using Densenet and PyTorch

In this project i used Densenet for image classification in PyTorch with custom sampling function for pytorch [imbalanced-dataset-sampler](https://github.com/koushik-elite/imbalanced-dataset-sampler)

Final Project [Notebook](/Using%20Densenet%20and%20PyTorch.ipynb)


## 1. Installation

Download Anaconda

|        | Linux | Mac | Windows | 
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| 64-bit | [64-bit (bash installer)][lin64] | [64-bit (bash installer)][mac64] | [64-bit (exe installer)][win64]
| 32-bit | [32-bit (bash installer)][lin32] |  | [32-bit (exe installer)][win32]

[win64]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64.exe
[win32]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86.exe
[mac64]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
[lin64]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
[lin32]: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86.sh

**Install** [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

## 2. Create and Activate the Environment

Please go though this [doc](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) before you creating an environment.
After that create a environment using following command

```
conda create --name deep-learning
```

Then activate the environment using following command

```
activate deep-learning
```

#### Git and version control
These instructions also assume you have `git` installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first with the command:
```
conda install git
```

**Now, you can create a local version of the project**

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.
```
git clone https://github.com/koushik-elite/Using-Densenet-and-PyTorch.git
cd Using-Densenet-and-PyTorch
```

2. Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.
	
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch 
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch -c pytorch
	pip install torchvision
	```

3. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. That's it!, Now run the project using following command, check you default browser and open "Using Densenet and PyTorch.ipynb" file

```
jupyter notebook
```
